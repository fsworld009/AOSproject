1.type
make ds
to compile dumpswitch

2.type
make n
to compile nodes

How to run
first run ./dumpswitch.out, it will start to listen
then run ./node.out [nodeid] [algorithm] on each node machine ([algorithm]: 0=ours, 1=Maekawa's)
each node will connects to the dumpswitch

After all connections are setup, dumpswitch will trigger the nodes to start algorithm
After computation you can find logs on ./log/ (I only keep the last one for each node and switch)


If you want to add/delete nodes or run test on netid machines, edit ./config/socket.txt
Structure of socket.txt
[socket port]
[num of switches] (do not change this one now,always put 1)
[net machine id of the switch] (0=localhost)
[num of nodes]
rest of the file are the net machine id of each node, 0=localhost
